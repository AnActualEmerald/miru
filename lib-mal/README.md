# lib-mal
A library for interacting with the MyAnimeList API

Handles authorization, requiring only a client ID from the MyAnimeList API and the user to authorize the application using the URL generated by the `MALClient`.
Tokens are cached by default but this can be disabled when creating the client.

API functions are a work in progress

Manga list functions are currently unsupported, but may be implemented in the future
